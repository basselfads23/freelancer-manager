Freelancer Manager - v2.0.0
A simple web application built with Flask to help freelancers manage their projects and clients.

Features
This version includes the following features:

Project Management:

Create projects with a title, description (notes), and a deadline.

View all projects on a central dashboard, sorted by deadline.

See a color-coded status for each project (e.g., "Due in X days", "Overdue").

Delete projects with a confirmation prompt.

Client Management:

Create and manage a list of clients with their name and email.

Assign projects to specific clients using a dropdown menu.

View which client a project belongs to on the main dashboard.

Delete clients, with a safeguard that prevents deletion if they still have projects assigned to them.
