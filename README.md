Freelancer Manager is a powerful, all-in-one business management tool designed for the modern freelancer. It streamlines the entire workflow from project inception to final payment, providing a centralized platform to track work, manage finances, and maintain professional client relationships.

## New in Version 6.0: The Billing & Profitability Overhaul

This version transforms the application into a complete financial toolkit by introducing advanced billing methods, integrated time and expense tracking, and custom branding.

- **Advanced Project Billing**:

  - **Flexible Billing Types**: Set a billing method for each project: **Hourly Rate**, **Flat Fee**, or **Per Task**. The application's UI intelligently adapts to your choice.
  - **Integrated Time Tracking**: For hourly projects, track your work with a **real-time Start/Stop timer** on each task or log time manually for offline work.

  - **Automated Invoicing**: With the new **"Generate Invoice from Tasks"** button, you can create a complete, detailed invoice in a single click. The system automatically pulls all completed, unbilled tasks and their logged time or fixed fees, eliminating repetitive data entry.

- **Expense Tracking & Profitability Reporting**:

  - **Log Expenses**: A new section allows you to record and categorize business expenses associated with your projects.
  - **Calculate Net Profit**: The main dashboard is now upgraded to display your **net profit** (Total Revenue - Total Expenses), giving you a true, at-a-glance understanding of your financial health.

- **Custom Invoice Branding**:
  - **Upload Your Logo**: A new settings page allows you to upload your business logo.
  - **Professional PDFs**: Your logo will automatically appear on all downloaded PDF invoices, ensuring a professional and branded look for your clients.
