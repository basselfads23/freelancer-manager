# Freelancer Manager SaaS

A lightweight, powerful web application designed to help freelancers and small service-based businesses manage their projects, track tasks, and eventually, generate invoices seamlessly. The goal is to provide a simple, intuitive tool that reduces administrative overhead and lets freelancers focus on their client work.

This project is being built iteratively using Python (Flask) for the backend and standard web technologies for the frontend.

  * **Project Management:** Create and view projects, each with a title and description.
  * **Task Management:** Break down projects into smaller, manageable tasks.
  * **Client Management:** Store and manage a directory of clients, linking them to their respective projects.
  * **Project Deadlines:** Assign and display a due date for each project to help with time management.

      * **Hourly:** Set an hourly rate.
      * **Fixed Fee:** Set a single, fixed price for the entire project.
      * **Per-Item:** (UI in place, logic to come).
  * **Database Migrations:** Uses `Flask-Migrate` (Alembic) to safely manage changes to the database schema.
